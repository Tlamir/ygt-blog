Optimization for Everyone is an open-source Python application designed to make **meta-heuristic optimization accessible, comparable, and visualizable**.
It was created to help researchers, students, and enthusiasts **run, compare, and analyze optimization algorithms** on standard benchmark problems with minimal setup.

## Why this project?

Optimization is at the heart of engineering, AI, and applied mathematics. While there are many algorithms out there, comparing them side-by-side can be confusing or require heavy coding.
This project provides:

- A **simple interface** to choose algorithms and benchmark functions.
- **Automatic plotting** of convergence curves.
- **Exported results** for reproducibility and later analysis.

## Features

- Compare up to three algorithms simultaneously on a single convergence plot.
- Adjust algorithm parameters to test different hyperparameter settings.
- Includes a library of 16+ benchmark functions (e.g., Ackley, Sphere, Rastrigin).
- Saves results with detailed metadata: optimizer, function, run times, best value, and best solution.
- Support for custom objective functions defined in NumPy.
- Multiple built-in meta-heuristic algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, HHO, SMA).
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Licensed under MIT for free use and extension.
