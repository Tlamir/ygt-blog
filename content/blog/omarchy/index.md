I recently tried **Omarch**, the Arch-based distro made by **DHH** (creator of Ruby on Rails), and Iâ€™m honestly blown away. This isnâ€™t just Arch preinstalled with a few packages â€” itâ€™s a **complete, curated system**.

Omarchy comes with **Hyprland**, **LazyVim**, and an entire development setup ready to go â€” but what impressed me most is how **effortless** everything feels. The configuration and setup experience is smooth, consistent, and genuinely enjoyable.

And the best part? Itâ€™s a **single ISO install** that sets up a complete development environment, and a keyboard-driven workflow in minutes. You donâ€™t spend hours configuring like you would with vanilla Arch â€” you reboot, log in, and youâ€™re ready to work.

For now, I installed Omarch on my thinkpad, and Iâ€™m not ready to switch my Fedora desktop just yet. Fedora is still my main machine, and I keep **Windows** around for two things I canâ€™t replace:
- **NVIDIA GPU performance** â€” my RTX 3080 runs at full speed and drivers are far more stable and performant in Windows than on Linux.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** â€” for some C++ projects, Visual Studio and its build tools are still the most reliable and convenient choice.

*My Current Setup. Omarchy even comes with cool screen savers. (Just Ignore the cables i hade to replace one of them recently ðŸ˜±)*

Even so, Omarch might be the most exciting development setup Iâ€™ve tried. It feels like a hackerâ€™s dream machine, right out of the box, and I love how easy it is to configure and make my own.

By the way, this site youâ€™re reading is built with **Zola**, the Rust-based static site generator, using the **Tabi** theme â€” fast, clean, and perfect for sharing posts like this.
