Hello, I’m Yigithan, a Software Engineer passionate about technology and solving challenging problems. I currently work in **graphics programming** and **C++**, while exploring other areas of development. Over the years, I’ve worked on projects using different languages, tools, and platforms, gaining experience across multiple domains.


Beyond coding, I enjoy video games, coffee, and exploring technology in all its forms. This blog is where I share my projects, experiments, and insights, from development challenges to personal hobbies.

I’m always open to discussions, collaborations, or interesting projects. Whether it’s sharing ideas, exploring new challenges, or occasional freelance work, feel free to get in touch.
